
 with all my heart
i miss you
now
you get larger in my heart each day
my heart gets hotter
like i'm hugging the sun
i worry
if i'm thinking too many steps ahead
it feels like i've become volcanic
that can't hold it in any more
what can i do about this feeling?
i miss you now
i want to meet you in this moment
a question named you is the big assignment
in my daily life
i want to solve you
one by one
i want to talk
about the many things full in my heart
i want to say in your warm arms
not in my cliche dreams
i like you a lot
with all my heart
i wonder
if you're like me in some ways
if you stay up all night
thiking the same things
i just wonder if you might
i miss you now
i want to meet you at this moment
i want to say in your warm arms
not in my cliche dreams
i like you a lot
very close
reachable by hand
there is my true heart
i would burst into tears with just a touch
if you understand, would you come to me?
i want to know
who am i to you?
a question names you is the big assignment
in my daily life
i spend the day frustrated
i want to meet you now
i want to talk to you about many things
i want to say in you warm arms
not in my cliche dreams
i like you a lot
you're the only one
you're my miracle
really, i like you a lot
with all my heart 


 time hidden behind an unknown secret
the moment hidden secret gets solved
mysterious you, secretive me
we meet to become one universe
all of the twinkling stars
become meaningless
when i wake up
i feel sad that
it was just a dream
just like that
looking at shooting stars by myself
what was that like?
has it started already?
totally unaware of the time hidden behind an unknown secret
i want to close in towards you
it will work out
shouldn't stop like this
i'll try harder quickly
the secret of a secret will be solved
heart-throbbing, awkward tremor
i can't explain
actually i might have many questions for you
what is your password?
may i know?
totally unaware of the time hidden behind an unknown secret
i want to close in towards you
it will work out
shouldn't stop like this
i'll try harder quickly
will the secret of a secret be solved?
can i meet you
at the end of this beam of darkness?
i still don't know
far away along that light
time engraved in the unknown secret faster to the second
everything will happen
when i cross this sleepless night
could you greet me at the front?
i would work harder and quicker then
a new world will open up to me 

 ALWAYS, I GET OVERWHELMED
LOOKING AT YOU ALWAYS BY MY SIDE
IT WAS SUCH A RAINY DAY
I STILL REMEMBER THAT TIME
IT WAS YOU WHO CAME TO ME, GOT ME UP
YOU WERE MORE EARNEST THAN THE RAINFALL
I HAVE A WISH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU
PLEASE STAY AS YOU ARE
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND FOREVER
I CAN GET ANYWHERE AS LONG AS YOU'RE WITH ME
I WANT IT EVEN AFTER A LONG TIME
SO PRECIOUS, SO DESIRED
THE DREAM OF JUST THE TWO OF US
I NEVER WANT TO WAKE UP
THE DREAM OF JUST THE TWO OF US
YOU AND I, WE PROMISED
CROSSING OUR FINGERS FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
THAT ONLY GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO US
FROM NOW ON
IF WE CHASE THE STARLIGHTS THAT HAS LANDED FAR AWAY
AND END UP LOSING THE GRASP OF OUR HANDS
I'LL FIND YOU AGAIN, ACROSS GALAXIES
I'LL NEVER PART WITH YOU AGAIN
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND FOREVER
I CAN GET ANYWHERE AS LONG AS YOU'RE WITH ME
I WANT IT EVEN AFTER A LONG TIME
SO PRECIOUS, SO DESIRED
THE DREAM OF JUST THE TWO OF US
ALWAYS, ALWAYS
FULL OF YOU, YOU'RE MY UNIVERSE
THE WORLD IN FRONT OF US FEELS MYSTIC
IT'S EXCITING, EVERYDAY WITH YOU
I DREAM AN ENDLESS DREAM
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND FOREVER
I CAN GET ANYWHERE AS LONG AS YOU'RE WITH ME
I WANT IT EVEN AFTER A LONG TIME
SO PRECIOUS, SO DESIRED
THE DREAM OF JUST THE TWO OF US
I NEVER WANT TO WAKE UP
THE DRAEM OF JUST THE TWO OF US
