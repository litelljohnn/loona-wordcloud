
nine o'clock every morning, you show up at the bell
i see you every day but i still get excited
i'm somehow awkward and still a little shy
but i like you too

i'm clumsy and not good at expressing
but you already know my heart without saying
i like you too
i trust you too, so
please understand me too

you, stop surprising, surprising me like that
stop bringing your lips close without warning
it's too quick, just give me a hug
kiss is for later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later

i'm not like the protagonist of a romance flick
but not shallow like a child all the time either
a girl, you know, keeps and keeps
wanting to make sure

how're you going to whine like an immature kid
keep by me like a reliable oppa
if you like me
if those feelings are true
will you help me believe you

you, stop surprising, surprising me like that
stop bringing your lips close without warning
it's too quick, just give me a hug
kiss is for later

lightly, lightly when your hand even brushes mine
trembles, trembles my heart
keep speed with me, don't rush ahead

acting like it's a joke, like you're cross, won't work
i need to prepare my mind, so wait
i like you too
but today, give me a hug

it's too quick, all for today
kiss is for later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later
kiss, kiss, kiss later



oh, after opening my eyes back again
(suddenly i)
feel like i'm in a new world
a melody that beckons to me
footsteps already headed there
an attraction that can't be explained

unfamiliar sights and
the dusk-soaked street
a smile that begins to spread

you're like a sunday
sunday, my sunday
a fluttering that's like rest
wanna be, wanna be your love
you make special an ordinary day
shine bright like stars in the sky
you are sunday, sunday, sunday love

oh, memory in time that stopped for a moment
(i remember)
feel like i've been reborn
a melody that welcomes me
footsteps already headed there
you don't need it explained

unfamiliar memories 
collect one by one
everything is precious

you're like a sunday
sunday, my sunday
a fluttering that's like rest
wanna be, wanna be your love
you make special an ordinary day
shine bright like stars in the sky

ran until out of breath
but the end of that day wasn't in sight
a yesterday that's passed
now will come
a day brighter than the shining sun

you are sunday, sunday
you are sunday, sunday
will you hold my hand
sunday, my sunday
today, i really
wanna be, wanna be your love
you make special an ordinary day
shine bright like stars in the sky
you are sunday, sunday, sunday love



oh, after opening my eyes back again
(suddenly i)
feel like i'm in a new world
a melody that beckons to me
footsteps already headed there
an attraction that can't be explained

unfamiliar sights and
the dusk-soaked street
a smile that begins to spread

wherever my two feet land
i'm happy as long as it's with you
where my gaze rests, right there
like a hidden present is your love
i'll show you deep down my heart
your everything becomes my song
my melody
shining even more today, starry eyes

oh, memory in time that stopped for a moment
(i remember)
feel like i've been reborn
a melody that welcomes me
footsteps already headed there, baby
you don't need it explained

unfamiliar memories 
collect one by one
everything is precious

wherever my two feet land
i'm happy as long as it's with you
where my gaze rests, right there
like a hidden present is your love
i'll show you deep down my heart
your everything becomes my song
my melody

ran until out of breath
but the end of that day wasn't in sight
a yesterday that's passed
now will come
a day brighter than the shining sun

wherever my two feet land
i'll make this day with you
where my gaze rests, right there
you're like a hidden present, with you

wherever my two feet land
i'm happy as long as it's with you
where my gaze rests, right there
like a hidden present is your love
i'll show you deep down my heart
your everything becomes my song
my melody
shining even more today, starry eyes
