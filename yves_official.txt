
 the look of you when i open my eyes
so bright that i couldn't dare to approach
my heart that wants to be like you
gets colored, filled with you
willing to get closer to the sun
flapping of the burnt wings
my miserable appearances
only then i learnt my new days
all my life by my life
take a look at me now
all my life by my life
blooming like sweet seduction
another shape of me found inside of me
my face in the mirror
i ask myself who it is
in the cold breeze of early morning
pulsating heart
that moment i looked myself squarely
i realized my new face
all my life by my life
soar up into the sky now
all my life by my life
it all seemed to reachable
the lights on the stage drift apart
light, the beam inside of my heart
when it shines on my dream quietly
the new me learnt about me
always, always all my life
refreshed new days
all my life by my life
always all my life
i'll trust myself, all my life
no matter what, by my life
with bright lights, all my life
i'll hold myself, all my life
