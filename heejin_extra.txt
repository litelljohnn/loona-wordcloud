from the morning, already deja vu
today's unfamiliar but again the same
should i hide or try to run
i ponder and ponder

i shuffle inside a black hat
but i get the same thing all the time
a white rabbit or pigeon
that's all same

every day inside my head, flash
used to shine, a rainbow
a world without color is dull
will you change it with your fingertips
red, orange, yellow, green, even more deeply
be okay

oh my god, yes
say oh my god, yes
color me full, with many colors
oh my god, yes
say oh my goodness
all day long i've been smiling
until my heart is pounding

with many colors
fill me, red orange yellow green
something highlight
surprising changes
all day long i've been smiling
until my heart is pounding

happy ending, same conclusion again
me without you, so what i can do
this repertoire with nothing to it
stop, stop it

i want to walk, like runway
look haughty but a little different
i'll show myself to you
that's my heart

every day inside my head, flash
used to shine, a rainbow
the same black-and-white movie every time is dull
will you change it with your fingertips
red, orange, yellow, green, even more deeply
be okay

oh my god, yes
say oh my god, yes
color me full, with many colors
oh my god, yes
say oh my goodness
all day long i've been smiling
from the moment i met you

good morning, i hope that
every morning i wake is a new day
i don't want to become dulled
to me, who's lost the light

oh my god, yes
say just like today
full like that, with even more colors
the same color
say a unique color
so that every, every person is anxious
and pounding like crazy

with many colors
fill me, red orange yellow green
something highlight
surprising changes
all day long i've been smiling
because you're looking at me
