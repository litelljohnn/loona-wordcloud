
this is our fantasy
come to me, follow me
trembling in my heart 
(hush) suffocating
hey baby, your brushing gazes that no one knew
seem to excite me

(cupid love)
in one moment tension gives out
breath that leaks out
spreads out without end
the sweet voice heard in dreams 
(look over your back)

it's begun, eclipse
inside the veiled shadow, where you and i are faced
it happened in destiny
hearts drawn to each other, light up this love
come a little bit closer
this is eclipse

it's hard to look away
so will you stay here
unforgettable eclipse
it's destiny

colors different from mine
are diverse, so it's curious
hidden in feelings is
(color) that i'll show you
hey baby, i'll look under the lights so no one knows
i'm so curious, i could go crazy

(cupid love)
your feelings, blurred by light
i can see at a glance
it's like pandora's box
a picturesque silhouette inside the mirror, i call you
(to my side, yeah)

it's begun, eclipse
inside the veiled shadow, where you and i are faced
it happened in destiny
hearts drawn to each other, light up this love
come a little bit closer
this is eclipse

it's hard to look away
so will you stay here
unforgettable eclipse
it's destiny

in quiet morning (wrap me in embrace)
like the settled fog (settled without sound)
in your mind, i will bloom
(even after time) it won't disappear, forever

continuing eclipse
inside the veiled shadow, where you and i are faced
it happened in destiny
hearts drawn to each other, light up this love
come a little bit closer
this is eclipse

it's hard to look away
so will you stay here
this is eclipse
it's destiny
it's hard to look away
so will you stay here
unforgettable eclipse



3 a.m. again today
my eyes opened again
i pull my covers over but

stare at the ceiling
count the sheep
does morning actually come

the night will only get longer
memories will only get deeper

those warm hands
that soft voice
without you i can't fall asleep
oh baby, baby
even moonlight by the window
seems like you, seems like you
oh baby, baby
i can't sleep

the coffee must have been too strong
i blame caffeine
it's not because of you that i'm like this

i open a book again
but i can't pay attention
i blankly hold my pillow

the night will only get longer
memories will only get deeper

those warm hands
that soft voice
without you i can't fall asleep
oh baby, baby
even moonlight by the window
seems like you, seems like you
oh baby, baby
i can't sleep

the morning call to wake me up
the evening note to bid me goodnight
neither will be there anymore
are they gone now

memories will only get deeper
i miss you baby

those warm hands
that soft voice
without you i can't fall asleep
oh baby, baby
even moonlight by the window
seems like you, seems like you
oh baby, baby
i can't sleep

the night will only get longer
memories will only get deeper

oh baby, baby
this one star that shines especially bright
seems like you, seems like you
oh baby, baby
i can't sleep
