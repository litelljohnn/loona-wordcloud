
 you attack my heart
you attack my heart
the day we first met, inside my quiet heart
as if a new world has opened
accelerate particularly, move
even my hidden secrets that only i knew
that mood that i wanted to tell you all about
the fact that i took a step towards you first
it lets me find myself that i didn't even know
pounding more and more
i'll give it all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
it shines fully in my heart
this must be what thrill feels like, darling
eventually i fall into you
you attack my heart
you attack my heart
you attack my heart
this is what "fall in love" is
dipped you inside my white heart, and made it red
can't stop thinking about you
i keep thinking about you more and more
all of my standards are set to you
like the moon spinning around the earth
we will, woo woo, be seeing each other
on the woo woo woo on the love trail
when i see you, spark
it's like there is a spark in my heart
i find my hidden feelings
pouonding more and more
i'll give it all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
it shines fully in my heart
this must be what thrill feels like, darling
eventually i fall into you
you attack my heart
i don't even realize how the time goes
anywhere anywhere, i think about you
anytime anyplace, it's full of you spreading out
come a little bit closer to me
if we face each other
even an imagination feels so sweet
my heart pounding towards you
i'll give it all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
it shines fully in my heart
it's getting clearer
i'll give you all my heart, take my heart
surely we're destiny
it shines fully tonight
this must be what sweet addiction is, darling
i fall deeper into you
pounding more and more
i'll give it all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
it shines fully in my heart
this must be what thrill feels like, darling
eventually i fall into you
you attack my heart
