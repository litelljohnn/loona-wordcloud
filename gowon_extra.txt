
woo yeah
oh feel my one and only

that moment when the sun falls asleep
i just get in a good mood
since starlight is so pretty too

when the shadow that walked
in locked steps with me approaches me first
even the dark feels bright

the moonlight illuminating like a sky full of spotlights
and there i am dancing underneath, shining
i've imagined this moment of light
that door has opened, baby

ah, closing the eyes
putting out the lips and kissing me
oh, opening the eyes
in this sparkling moment, i see the real me

one & only
my one & only
my one & only love

the one who can illuminate my heart
is only me, one & only

even if you say i fell into
and live in a strange world, i'm okay
because i'm the protagonist

i don't need no eden
because it means this time in my hands
is itself heaven

feels like any dream could come true
spread out into my days
the secret door to happiness
has opened all the way, baby

ah, closing the eyes
putting out the lips and kissing me
oh, opening the eyes
in this sparkling moment, i see the real me

one & only
my one & only
my one & only love

my new appearance, reflected on the window
isn't unfamiliar anymore
to the voice that comes heard again
be listening carefully

ah, in this universe
that i met myself can't be a coincidence
oh, now i understand
the reason why swaying flowers bloom

one & only
my one & only
my one & only love
one & only
my one & only
my one & only
my one & only love



i see you
no, you're not in front me right now
i saw you
that's right

it's been a long day
not that anything's made me that tired
it's been a long, long day
maybe i drank too much coffee today

sometimes i smile genuinely
but most of it
is a day filled with fake laughs

my feelings like a seesaw errday
maybe something makes me up and down
since the day after you left

i see you
no, you're not in front me right now
i saw you
that's right
i see you
am i dreaming right now
i saw you
i'm like see saw

here and there, i'm like see saw
up and down, i'm like see saw

which is right
i see or saw you
which is right
i love or loved you

even if i saw you again
i don't want to be in your arms again
i've no desire to see your face, now

out of my mind
when there were no lies in your eyes
when they shone upon me fully
i just think of you back then

i see you
no, you're not in front me right now
i saw you
that's right
i see you
am i dreaming right now
i saw you
i'm like see saw

here and there, i'm like see saw
up and down, i'm like see saw

you appear, then disappear, over and over
i'm so weak, where are you going leaving me
where have you gone
i'm like see saw

here and there, i'm like see saw
up and down, i'm like see saw

which is right
i see or saw you
which is right
i love or loved you
