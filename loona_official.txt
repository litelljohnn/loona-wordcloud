
 i know that you're looking at me
more than anyone
but i just want to keep teasing you
no, what am i doing?
i should just take you in
i'm not playing hard-to-get but boys will be boys
watch out, watch out, watch out
it won't be easy
quite many secrets
i don't want to pass my love on to you so easily
because i'm special
because i'm that pretty girl
tell me, show me, make you more anxious
say hi hi hi hi, make me say hi
take me high high high high, take me even higher
in the dreams, love love love love, make it pound and pound
(it's true)
a little bit more (someday)
try harder (oh yeah)
it shouldn't be so easy
love is supposed to be cruel
text me, more often, tell me that sweet story
then i will, once or twice a day
i'm being more egoistic than i have ever been
it's you, yeah
i love you, i want to look at only you
don't you want to hear me say that?
just wait a little bit, some more
making you even more anxious
even when i don't say anything
please don't ask
i get quite a bit shy sometimes, that's all
i get worried
that you might get tired of it
and also that you might find out about my real feelings
say hi hi hi hi, make me say hi
take me high high high high, take me even higher
in the dreams, love love love love, make it pound and pound
(it's true)
a little bit more (someday)
try harder (oh yeah)
love is even more cruel than college entrance exams
i actually like you
everything about you
but i worry
long-waited love
if that's really you
i need just a little bit more time
let me see you
sweet to sweet
sweet and sour
spicy so spicy
spicy and sour
fresh so fresh
fresh and spicy
it makes me dizzy
take me high high high high, i love this feeling
my heart is pounding (so bad)
what should i do (oh yeah)
my heart is all excited, getting excited, what should i do
high
high
like gimbap, you're like dumplings, so sweet 


 will you whisper to me?
you're the dejavu that wakes me up
now
is it you now?
i can feel it coming
a mirage with wings
how?
is it true now?
it surrounds me, holding me, wind
feels like i'm being born again
gaze that fills me up
you
might be a dream
this moment
dreams, dreams, may come true
you just
fly like a butterfly
taking me far away
wings wings
just like this
fly like a butterfly
sounds of winds blowing around my ears
wing
fly like a butterfly
i feel like i could reach it
i better be around you
fly like a butterfly
fly like a butterfly
i better be around you
it gets dizzy
everything around me is blue
now
with you you now
a folded paper moon
like i'm wandering in-between
i better be around you
it starts with a small flap
now, inside my heart, a hurricane
been been there
never been been there
the world gets smaller and smaller
take me there, way too far
becomes new
this moment
dreams, dreams may come true
you just
fly like a butterfly
taking me far away
wings wings
just like this
fly like a butterfly
sounds of winds blowing around my ears
wing
just like this
fly like a butterfly
i feel like i could reach it
i better be around you
till the end of that road
fly like a butterfly
even further
fly like a butterfly
till the end of that road
fly like a butterfly
i better be around you
on top of the clouds, synchronize
this new feeling
bling, bling, shine like a starlight
breath-taking time
it becomes perfect
let me fly right now
you just
fly like a butterfly
please fly higher
wings wings
just like this
fly like a butterfly
sounds of grazing winds
wing
i better be around you
fly like a butterfly
taking me far away
wings wings
even further
just like this
fly like a butterfly
sounds of winds blowing around my ears
i feel like i could reach it
i better be around you
