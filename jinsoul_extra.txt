
the song of this deepening night
i can't even stop it, out of control
say i don't know where it begins
yet it colors the night, yeah

towards, towards the sound you and i run (we follow)
deep, deep, deepens the secret (we're absorbed)
rain soaks, soaks the atmosphere (it thickens)
hey, it thickens, everything of you and me

for the sin of having swallowed the daytime sun
burning up, here i am
on this night, left all alone with you (ringing)

singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain

i was too dangerous to touch
but suddenly wrapped around by your blue
until the end of this night, stay with me
deeper, even deeper

oh yeah, tonight the two of us let's make a secret
mixed with the sound of rain, spreads the love song
show me more, your light, all right
stay in me all night
until the last moment, stay only by my side

for the sin of having swallowed all the stars in the sky
spread blue, you are
you and i stand atop this night
and as this song falls down

singing in the rain
singing in the rain (and as this song falls down)
singing in the rain
singing in the rain

singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain

hey boy, i've been thinking about us
got me singing in the rain
singing in the rain

towards, towards the sound you and i run (we follow)
deep, deep, deepens the secret (we're absorbed)
rain soaks, soaks the atmosphere (we're soaked)
hey, it's soaked, the sun inside of us now

for the sin of having swallowed the daytime sun
burning up, here i am
on this night, left all alone with you (ringing)

singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain



lonely, lonely

flowers i got from you
all close their eyes
like the two of us
towards you, my (feelings)
and excitement too (at some point)
are like my heart that turned away

you and i are immersed in memories
and erase each other out

listen, listen, only to you
i wanted to pour out my heart
nothing, nothing, no more
meanings disappear
what remains, love letter

i'm really really lonely
on the tip of my tongue
love me love me
i'm really really lonely
my feelings swallowed up
hold me hold me

like how with the love you gave me
my heart couldn't
bloom once again
left alone (alone)
over that time (already)
it's like traces that blur

you and i are immersed in reminiscence
and must erase each other out

listen, listen, only to you
i wanted to pour out my heart
nothing, nothing, no more
meanings disappear
what remains, love letter

already cold
were your eyes
and myself nowhere to be found
words i couldn't tell you
are all useless

listen, listen, only to you
i wanted to pour out my heart
nothing, nothing, no more
with meanings gone
the last love letter

i'm really really lonely
on the tip of my tongue
love me love me
i'm really really lonely
my feelings swallowed up
hold me hold me

lonely, lonely
