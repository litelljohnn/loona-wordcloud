
you attack my heart
you attack my heart
you attack my heart
you attack my heart

the day we first met
in my quiet mind
as if a new world opened
a particularly quickening move

known only to myself
my hidden secret
everything about me to you
i was in a mood to tell you all

one step first, towards you first
having approached
i meet with myself who was hiding

my heart races more and more
i'll give you all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
light shines, filling my heart
this must be a thrilling feeling, darling
i fall for you more and more
you attack my heart

you attack my heart
you attack my heart
you attack my heart
you attack my heart

so this is falling in love, in my white heart
i hold you and it becomes red
i can't stop you popping into my head
and just think of you so much more

as if all of my standards are set to you
like that moon circling round the earth
we will, woo woo, end up meeting
on the, woo woo woo, on the love trail

when i see you, sparkle, in my heart sparkle
like sparks flying
i get to realize feelings hidden

my heart races more and more
i'll give you all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
light shines, filling my heart
this must be a thrilling feeling, darling
i fall for you more and more
you attack my heart

enough to lose track of time
anywhere, anywhere i think of you
anytime, anyplace is full of you, spreading endlessly
come a little bit closer
if the two of us were facing each other
even the thought feels so sweet

my heart races more and more
i'll give you all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
light shines, my heart is full

my heart is clearer and clearer
i'll give you all, take my heart
surely we are destiny
light shines, filling this night
this must be a sweet addiction, darling
i fall for you ever deeper

my heart races more and more
i'll give you all, take my heart
surely you're my destiny
light shines, filling my heart
this must be a thrilling feeling, darling
i fall for you more and more
you attack my heart
