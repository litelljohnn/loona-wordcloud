
is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
this little wish i've dreamt of
if only you'll be with me
like that song
the sound of bells to my ears
and the white snow i've waited for

the christmas melody through every snowy street
that december day i used to be excited for
became a lost and old memory sometime but
in the world that became white overnight
it feels like something will come true

when the little glowing lights descend on my heart
i'll work up the courage to say it, the time i've waited for

is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
this little wish i've dreamt of
if only you'll be with me, only you
the sound of bells to my ears
and the white snow i've waited for
all pile up in my heart, our very own
it's christmas time

in the deep night, wishing in excitement
can't fall asleep, spent all night waiting
and memories come back in a bunch

when the little glowing lights turn on one by one
i'll work up the courage to say it, the time i've waited for

is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
this little wish i've dreamt of
if only you'll be with me, only you
the sound of bells to my ears
and the white snow i've waited for
all pile up in my heart, our very own
it's christmas time

the girl-like excitement of this month, december
with you, it all comes back
it feels like anything could come true, with you

it pounds, pounds, pounds my heart
the little miracle i've been wishing for
if only you'll stay with me, only you
childhood reminiscence
precious memories
all seem to come back, remain with me
my christmas time



deep inside my mind, that dark place
into which you suddenly came in
though it will fall back asleep someday
awaken my world

it mustn't be a coincidence
it mustn't be hurried
sweet whispers to the ear
over the night sky, let me in

the moon rises and i become you
though we were so different
my heart becomes colored by you
the girl is the boy's girl

the wind blows and deep in my heart
floats a petal
though it might cool again
melt my heart

you knock and i hesitate
when i open my eyes from the long night's dream
will i be you or will you be me
i've been waiting so long

the moon rises and i become you
though we were so different
my heart becomes colored by you
the girl is the boy's girl

having come to resemble you,
having become accustomed to you
a girl of yours only

the moon rises and i become you
though we were so different
whenever i see you my heart starts to soften
the girl is the boy's girl
the boy is the girl's boy
the girl is the boy's wish
