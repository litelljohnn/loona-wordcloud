
my hand that grazes yours as we walk
the lemonade you pass me after a sip
the flutters you blow into me all day
make my heart full to the brim
my heart, blown like bubble gum

what is love, from a to z i may not know
but this feeling of the ears trembling

i've fallen, love cherry motion
into the midsummer night's purple dream
love cherry magic
a paradise where i dream with you
in my eyes, in my heart, there you are
into my arms, come deeper, come you
love cherry motion
this story that begins today

ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah

when you call my name from behind
like a magnet i'm already in front of you
a feeling i've never felt before
but somehow it's not bad
very suddenly began the story

this feeling of the ears tickling

i've fallen, love cherry motion
into the midsummer night's purple dream
love cherry magic
a paradise where i dream with you
in my eyes, in my heart, there you are
into my arms, come deeper, come you
love cherry motion
this story that begins today

ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah ah

grab my trembling hands
you already know without saying right?
my face can't lie when
you gaze straight, so into you

feels like inside clouds, feel your love

i've fallen, love cherry motion
muster up courage and walk to you
love cherry magic
my dreams are full of you
in my eyes, in my heart, there you are
my whole world is dazzling bright
love cherry motion
special days that begin today



when the sun leaves me
i'm immersed in the secret called you

in the encroaching darkness
when that secret door that
no one could solve opens up
the light that diffused along with you
(yup) 24/7 you're like a password i want to solve
scattered like pieces, looking faint

even one minute, one second (of time) is precious (precious)
in your charms that i can't miss
between the cracks of time that passed by, you graze through
shall i piece together these interlocking gaps, yeah

the once unsolvable puzzle, puzzle
(from one to ten)
the unknowable trouble, trouble
(from the beginning to now)
in the endless maze
(from one to ten)
i want to find all of you
(everything about you)

the closer i get to you, you
quietly hide your tracks
questions that seem forever
unknowable become even bigger
(yup) 365 you're like a password, would you give me more hints?
hush, the secret you've hidden in your heart

a day and another (the time) passes by (passes by)
in your charms that only spread out
between the scattered space, showing through
is a heart made clearer, shall i look inside

the once unsolvable puzzle, puzzle
(from one to ten)
the unknowable trouble, trouble
(from the beginning to now)
in the endless maze
(from one to ten)
i want to find all of you
(everything about you)

so real, so good, inescapable
(so good good good)
so real, so good (you got me), inexorable

i might know, might not, getting curious
a question mark that only grows bigger
where do i start untangling
like a tangled spool, can't get better

1 step, 2 step, the more i get to know
1 step, 2 step, the closer i get
1 step, 2 step, the more i get to know
(the harder it gets, yeah yeah)
1 step, 2 step, the more i get to know
1 step, 2 step, the closer i get
1 step, 2 step, the more i get to know

the once unsolvable puzzle, puzzle
(from one to ten)
the untouchable bubble, bubble
(from the beginning to now)
like an ungraspable dream, yeah
(from one to ten)
i want to find all of you
(everything about you)

the once unsolvable puzzle, puzzle
(from one to ten)
the unknowable trouble, trouble
(from the beginning to now)
in the endless maze
(from one to ten)
i want to find all of you
(everything about you)
