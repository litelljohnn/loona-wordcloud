
 oh feel my one and only
that moment when the sun falls asleep
i get happy for no reason
the starlights are so pretty too
walking alongside of me
when that shadow takes a step towards me
even the darkness feels bright
the moon illuminating the sky like stage lightings
the shape of myself dancing under it sparkles
been imagining the shiny moments
that door has opened, baby
ah, with the eyes closed
when the lips pout and kiss me
oh, when i open my eyes
i face my true self at this shining moment
one & only
my one & only
my one & only
love
the only person that can shine a light in my heart
is me, one & only
being fallen into a weird world
even if you tell me so, i'm fine
i'm the leading role then
i don't need no garden of eden
the time in my hands
means that i'm already in heaven
the feeling that any dreams could come true
it's been spread in my life
the secret door to happiness
that door has opened, baby
ah, with the eyes closed
when the lips pout and kiss me
oh, when i open my eyes
i face my true self at this shining moment
one & only
my one & only
my one & only
love
the reflection of my new shape on the window
it feels familiar now
the voice being heard again
i'm trying to listen
in this universe
it's not a coincidence that i've met myself
oh, i know now
why the waving flowers bloom
one & only
my one & only
my one & only
love
one & only
my one & only
my one & only
my one & only love
