
with all my heart
i miss you, right now

in my mind, you become
a little bigger each day
my heart, warms up
as if it's embraced the sun

my thoughts, seem to rush ahead
and worry me
i think i've become a volcano
unable to hold it in anymore
what to do with my feelings

i miss you right now
i want to meet you in this moment
in my daily routines
the problem of you is a big assignment
i want to solve it one by one
my heart is full of stories
that i want to share with you
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot
with all my heart

in what ways are you
similar to me, i'm curious
maybe you're sleepless
from thinking the same things
i get my hopes up like this

i miss you right now
i want to meet you in this moment
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot

in a nearby place
so close that you could reach out
laid out is my heart
i might cry at the slightest touch
if you know it all, would you come to me

i want to know
what kind of person am i to you
in my daily routines
the problem of you is a big assignment
i go through the day frustrated
right now, i want to meet you
i want to share many conversations
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot

yes i am
you are the only one
you are my miracle
i really like you a lot

with all my heart


you and me together

at your shyly approaching gaze
my heart quivers
i see it boy

arriving to me after a long time
you feel like a present
i want you boy

blue skies and refreshing winds
a perfect today
and our stories that will fill this place
you and me together

once the excitement, twice the kiss
we couldn't hide
our party for just two
stars in the sky to fill this night
the story of you and me
you and me together

i won't keep you waiting
i won't keep you waiting

i'm awakened by warm sunshine
and smile at the song that i hear
the times i passed by without notice
become special today
i'm so very happy

blue skies and refreshing winds
a perfect today
and our stories that will fill this place
you and me together

once the excitement, twice the kiss
we couldn't hide
our party for just two
stars in the sky to fill this night
the story of you and me
you and me together

i won't keep you waiting
i won't keep you waiting

oh boy, i've long awaited
the first kiss of you and me
when the comfy warmth
spreads over my heart
the world is full of pink
i love you baby

once the excitement, twice the kiss
we couldn't hide
our party for just two
stars in the sky to fill this night
the story of you and me
you and me together

once the excitement, twice the kiss
we couldn't hide
our party for just two
stars in the sky to fill this night
the story of you and me
you and me together




you, i dream a dream of being with you
a dream of singing with you
the little melody that circles my ears
i just wanna be with you

the day it becomes rain and falls from the sky
the whole world will be filled with your scent

when i'm with you and in that sky
blue stars rise and shine
want to talk about the sunshine that's gone to hide
all night long as we fall asleep
from youthful days, my fairy tale

only you can make me
feel this way baby
words i want to say to you
don't ever let me go

the day it becomes rain and falls from the sky
the whole world will be filled with your scent

when i'm with you and in that sky
blue stars rise and shine
want to talk about the sunshine that's gone to hide
all night long as we fall asleep
from youthful days, my fairy tale

when i'm with you and in that sky
blue stars rise and shine
want to talk about the sunshine that's gone to hide
all night long as we fall asleep
from youthful days, my fairy tale



that day when it just started getting cold
that day when we first met
ever since, i've felt a certain way

so awkward, i couldn't look you in the eyes
stuttering through simple greetings
and frustrated as i turned around

shy as i was, with trembling hands
i stepped up and handed you that february chocolate

oh boy, to hold all of my heart
that box was too small
not even half of half of half
but if you felt it, if you realized my feelings
can i look forward to next month?

did the earth start spinning more slowly?
did february get longer starting this year?
why am i feeling so anxious?

maybe i pressured you too much
the day passes in pointless worrying

oh boy, to hold all of my heart
that box was too small
not even half of half of half
but if you felt it, if you realized my feelings
can i look forward to next month?

your voice calling to me
like melting, this sweet feeling
i get confused if this is a dream

but what if nothing comes out of it
what if it's the same as yesterday
then my feelings get really complicated
so this spring, show me your heart
i'll hope from you something sweeter than words
really, can i look forward to next month?



time that's veiled by an unknowable secret
a moment for the hidden secret to be unlocked

a mysterious you, a secretive me
the two meet and form a universe together
all those stars that shine
all made meaningless

waking from a dream, that it was a dream
suddenly saddens me
like that i, just by myself
watching a star fall

how did that feel
has it already begun

time that's veiled by an unknowable secret
that not even a minute, a second can be known
i want to close the distance to you
it will be aligned now
we can't stop like this
i'll hurry a little more, i'll try harder
the secret of the secret will be revealed

my heart was beating, in awkward tremor
i can't express it
really i, maybe for you
have so many questions
what's your password
can't i know it

time that's veiled by an unknowable secret
that not even a minute, a second can be known
i want to close the distance to you
it will be aligned now
we can't stop like this
i'll hurry a little more, i'll try harder
will the secret of the secret be revealed

a lone ray in the darkness
at the end of this path
could i meet you
i still don't know
following the faraway light

time that's written into an unknowable secret
to hurry every minute and second more
if i cross this sleepless night now
everything will come true
you can't come to greet me, can you
then i would hurry more, try harder
a new world will open



always been by my side
when i see you my heart rises up
that day it rained so much
i still remember that time

you came to me, raised me up
more earnest than the falling rain
i have a wish, i'm going to ask you
to stay here, just like now

forever, i want to hold hands with you
wherever, i can go if it's by your side
even after time's gone by
i want to dream this wanted, precious
dream of ours
just like this, don't want to wake from this
dream of ours

you and i promised
fingers linked
looking at me, that starting from today
only good things will happen for us

while following the starlight far away
if we ever let go of clasped hands
i'll cross the galaxy to find you
i'll never part from you again

forever, i want to hold hands with you
wherever, i can go if it's by your side
even after time's gone by
i want to dream this wanted, precious
dream of ours

always, anytime
you're my universe, full inside of me
the world to be in front of us is wondrous
i'm excited, every day with you
we dream an endless dream

forever, i want to hold hands with you
wherever, i can go if it's by your side
even after time's gone by
i want to dream this wanted, precious
dream of ours
just like this, don't want to wake from this
dream of ours
