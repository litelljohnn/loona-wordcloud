
i can't take my eyes off 
of our eclipse
(you were only visible to me)
too dangerous to touch
(woo boy) my heart
(is attracted to you more)

what is love, from a to z i still don't know
i just want to stay fallen for you
i've a mind to just ask of you

i like you, cool
every minute, second, my thoughts are all
full of you, baby i'm full
getting hotter and hotter
controllable less and less
coming closer and closer
my heart beats, cool
what do i do, cool
these feelings of mine
woo~
i'll confess first

oh boy, from my waking moment
the one i think of is you, my boy
since when did you enter my head, uh
(hey you)
i was cold but i'm warming up, wow

what is love, a to z i don't know either
but my heart keeps being drawn to you
i've a mind to shine bright towards you

i like you, cool
every minute, second, my thoughts are all
full of you, baby i'm full
getting hotter and hotter
controllable less and less
coming closer and closer
my heart beats, cool
what do i do, cool
these feelings of mine
woo~
i'll confess first

left in the place without end
only with you
memories that don't fade away
oh, like last night i didn't want to wake from, all night

my heart like this, cool
simply, simply where my heart leads
with you, towards there, i
get closer and closer
more and more to my side
go nearer and nearer
my heart beats, cool
would you cool it, cool
i'll go first
woo~
and say i love you



shining upon me, that moonlit spotlight
follows me slowly, contact my heart
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
my heart races today especially

perhaps prepared for me, this show
is like a dream i don't want to wake from
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
fly me to the moon now

fantasy, as if mesmerized by something
omg, the melody that spins and circles
rings through the ears, in that moment
i don't really care now

the milky way seems to envelop me (i'm not insane)
the song of translucent moonlight
i don’t really care now
hidden in my heart, would you light this secret
the torrent of light falling down
i don't really care now

the unstoppable starlight shower
soaks me in a little more
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
falling to the moon now

harmony, deep in my head
spinning and circling endlessly
reaches the lips, in that moment
i don't really care now

the milky way seems to envelop me (i'm not insane)
the song of translucent moonlight
i don’t really care now
hidden in my heart, would you light this secret
the torrent of light falling down
i don't really care now

shining upon me, that moonlit spotlight
follows me slowly, contact my heart
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
the familiar déjà vu of a forgotten night
floats up in a gaze, in this moment
i don't really care now

three moons rise up (i'm not insane)
between time that has stopped
i don't really care now
hidden in your heart, i want to open your secret
a night of an endless festival
i don't really care now



when the star falls and reaches my heart
i don't know what i should do
i can feel it baby
you are my storm, surrounding all of me
i want all of you
nothing less than everything, baby baby baby

this unstoppable attraction between you and me
unknowable secrets sprawled out endlessly
a universe saturated by light
colored by you, i'll go crazy
scattered between us, the blooming light
oriented towards each other, our heart
until i'm in your arms by your side
cause i'm about to lose control

chaotic, my heart is off time
trapped in a maze, i'm all night going
psychotic, i want you, you
falling in i'm, baby chaotic
chaotic, there's no coming out
dizzyingly wrapped by many lights, going
psychotic, when i close my eyes
i want to see your heart, baby chaotic

closing the distance between you and me
gravity, pulling each other closer
in my heart baby you set a fire
i need you right here
cause you kissing, oh kiss the best

that grazing melody
guide me towards you
and we will be true

ah~ slow dance
make a move slow dancing, come on

did it begin the moment i met you
where i ran out of the darkness, there you were
step by step, in matched steps
i read you

like lighting in the sky
the starlight slowly turn on
the password solved, this night unlocks

take me high, the moment i walked to follow you
my heart moved without knowing
my movements grew like yours
the secret only we know
is contained in this night

your every step, my every step (we gradually match)
can i make a move, you follow too (carefully still)
when clouds bloom and cover the moon
just the two of us slow dancing all night

what's your favorite color?
in whichever one you want
i slowly become colored
that's what i like, when you smile, the most
when the door opens, petals dance
and scatter with every step
walking with you, a smile comes out
i like it even if it rains

i fell in without sound 
into your eyes
the password solved, my heart unlocks

take me high, the moment i walked to follow you
my heart moved without knowing
my movements grew like yours
the secret only we know
is contained in this night

your every step, my every step (we match each other)
can i make a move, you follow too (carefully still)
when clouds bloom and cover the moon
just the two of us slow dancing all night

no words could express
our conversations, so natural
like an unbroken signal, it spreads out

in the deep dark universe (hey)
scattered are you and i (yes, you and i)
hesitant to approach, i found myself in you
to solve this mysterious secret in my heart
you became the key

take me high, the moment i walked to follow you
my heart moved without knowing
my movements grew like yours
the secret only we know
is contained in this night

your every step, my every step (we match each other)
can i make a move, you follow too (no need for words)
a seemingly familiar naturalness (woo yeah)
two become one and create together



hey boy, you wanna play?
it's a sweet crazy love

frozen hearts wake one by one
after you rose on my cloudy heart
i ran in curiosity, grasped that hand in secret
the moment they touched, i colored it in

(a little more) the closer we get
in a moment with you, my heartbeat races faster
(silent flow) the wind tickles my heart too
i'm excited to meet you

you move me, sweet move move move, start to move
look, i'm already full with you
even your risky gaze is all sweet
whatever the wordplay, i can only see your lips

come come come, come to me (babe babe babe)
if only you'll be with me
it's a sweet crazy love

boy, the excitement towards you
came together to make
this fluttering with you at the center
blow kiss on my cherry lips

oh boy, the song you gave me through a call
the fascinating melody (want to be the only one to hear)

(quietly) your voice came heard
the time with you, i've waited in secret too
(silent flow) in this night when even winds sleep
i'm excited to meet you

you move me, sweet move move move, start to move
look, i'm already full with you
even your risky gaze is all sweet
whatever the wordplay, i can only see your lips

come come come, come to me (babe babe babe)
if only you'll be with me
it's a sweet crazy love

no words could express
these feelings i'm so full of
it's like a fairy tale
only in movies
could love like this exist
but that's us, ah

it's begun, sweet move move move, in this secret
burst in my lips, your cherry motion
whatever the jokes, i can only see your lips, forever
with you, i'll stay

come come come, i come to you
(boy, today's like a dream)
it's a sweet crazy love (tell me, cause we only live once)
come come come, come to me (you don't know how to stop)
i'll hold your hands
blow kiss on my cherry lips
come come come, come to me
this love that only grows bigger
it's a sweet crazy love
it's a sweet crazy love



it's okay to be a little dangerous
the hidden sweetness behind the riskiness, like sweet dream
the heart races
when i open my secret door hidden deep
you and i
closed breaths that would fill our gap, hush
are you coming right now?

a slowly unveiling veil, ooh
a new sensation blooms

your attraction that wakes me
past the dicey line and border
it fills me up, this is new, it's you
what nobody knew
ooh ooh, the ocean in me, takes you
i'm with you
feelings that brim up more, something new, it's you

a mystery that seems new
(killing me softly, just take me slowly)
seeps in with each breath, oh
are you coming right now

slowly drawing near, ooh
a new sensation blooms

your attraction that wakes me
past the dicey line and border
it fills me up, this is new, it's you
what nobody knew
ooh ooh, the ocean in me, takes you
i'm with you
feelings that brim up more, something new, it's you

the confusing maze
your lips that call out to me
my moves colored in you
to the end of this world
will you take me
just take me there right now
a new sensation blooms

past the dicey line and border
don't let me hide, uncover me now

it's surprising, this beautiful sensation
past the limits of space and time
i add you, this is new, it's you
what nobody knew
ooh ooh, the soul in me is reborn
i'm with you
filling me up like cherry blue
it's you
