don't hesitate boy
your eyes go shake shake
hearts pounding girl
such a good feeling
stop hesitating
just come to me
when you smile
boy you rock my world, you rock me baby
pink world with you and me
this beautiful place colored by the sunshine
with full of hope
towards wherever the wind goes
boy you just give me your love
with me, can you feel
24/7 (i'll be there)
as ever every day (i'll be there)
our hearts becoming one
i'll be there
365 (i'll be there)
in the time (i'll be there)
together we
i'll be there
day day, new each day
heart throbbing nicely
i'll show it to you
i'll be there
time spreading in front of us, real slow
the world that belongs to you and me stays there
the dreamy time that have gone round and round
in front of my eyes now
make me feel so high, all the time
pink world with you and me
this beautiful place colored by the sunshine
with full of hope
towards wherever the wind goes
boy you just give me your love
with me, can you feel
24/7 (i'll be there)
as ever every day (i'll be there)
our hearts becoming one
i'll be there
365 (i'll be there)
in the time (i'll be there)
together we
i'll be there
day day, new each day
heart throbbing nicely
i'll show it to you
i'll be there
ooh baby, sunlight shining on us
i'll be everything you need
(i'll be everything you need)
ooh baby, pounding moonlight
i'll be everything you need
24/7 (i'll be there)
as ever every day (i'll be there)
our hearts becoming one
i'll be there
365 (i'll be there)
in the time (i'll be there)
together we
i'll be there
24/7 (i'll be there)
as ever every day (i'll be there)
our hearts becoming one
i'll be there
365 (i'll be there)
in the time (i'll be there)
together we
i'll be there 


i had to come again today
what would i do when i run into you
i wait cautiously
without wanting anything
i just stare vacantly, then leave
from far, i wish to be the only one
hey you, do you know how i'm feeling
like a child, i look at you while hiding, everyday
you, are you listening to me
i can't get my courage up
i just leave again without a word
i see you even with my eyes closed
what should i do now
everyone says i'm a fool
but i don't expect anything from you
hey you, do you know how i'm feeling
like a child, i look ay you while hiding, everyday
you, are you listening to me
i can't get my courage up
i just leave again without a word
(just say something)
you don't even know
(don't let go)
what do you think of me?
i can't spit those common words out
i just stare vacantly, then leave, same as any day
from far, i wish to be the only one
hey you, do you know how i'm feeling
like a child, i take a peep of you and run away, nowadays
you, can you hear me
i can't get my courage up
i just leave again without a word
