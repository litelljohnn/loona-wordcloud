
at some point, your expression became cold to me
i tried to hate, but my heart couldn't let you go
the saying that time lets you forget everything
even that became pain to me, i couldn't forget you

the petals that bloomed full in my heart, all fall down
my tears at the tip of my feet
the sun set on my way home, at the end of the darkness
there i saw the moonlight

now, rather than you
i'm going to love myself more, live on
taking one more step
i'm going to embrace myself more, give it all

love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
let you go today

hey, for the sin of having swallowed you
you, beautiful, grow larger
you are me, now i am you
having slowly seeped into my veins
on & on, an endless cycle, you and i
we can't be separated, when you miss me
close your eyes, i come near you for a moment
closing your eyes, approach me more and more

my hands clasped, asking to have you back just once
in prayers of my dreams
three kisses, the day when our promises became light
i finally knew

now, rather than you
i'm going to love myself more, live on
taking one more step
i'm going to embrace myself more, give it all

love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
let you go today

among the universe of countless stars, having met myself
is not coincidence, it must be destiny, must be a blessing, to me

now, rather than you
i'm going to love myself more, live on
taking one more step
i'm going to embrace myself more, give it all

love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
let you go today



like a flower, bloomed in thick darkness
i stand here, shaking a little precariously
drunk with the scent, you try to snap me
eyes wide open, staring at me

i'm sure you want me (i'm sure you want me)
but don't get pricked (don't get pricked)
carefully baby (carefully baby)
it won't be that easy
i'm just getting started (getting started)

wait, no no no no
i don't hate this nervousness
i know know know know
you're full of curiosity
i know know know know
you'll fall even deeper
little by little, you will

biting the reddened rose petal on your lips
feel this moment melting in
my breath trembles at your soft smile
now calm your tension and slowly reach out

i find you digging around in the thorny bush
people want to box and keep things that sparkle
the night deepens, hurry, run to me before you're lost
let me be risque, at the end of this night we bloom

feels more drowsy, will you be careful
to not get hurt, not get hurt
when you become curious at the gaze piercing you
i'm already hiding without you knowing

wait, no no no no
i don't hate this nervousness
i know know know know
you're full of curiosity
i know know know know
you'll fall even deeper
little by little, you will

following that light, shining on me quietly
i see you in the distance, transparent
i'm drawn even more, unable to stop

wait, no no no no
i don't hate this nervousness
i know know know know
you're full of curiosity
i know know know know
you'll fall even deeper
little by little, you will

my life is rosy
my life is rosy
i know know know know
you'll fall even deeper
little by little, you will
