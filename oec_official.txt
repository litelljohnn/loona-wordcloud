
 can't take my eyes off of
our eclipse
(only i could see you)
even my heart
(woo boy)
that was untouchably dangerous
(i get drawn to you more and more)
i don't know what love is, a to z
still don't know
i just want to be into you
just wanna pester you for no reason
i like you, i'm cool
each minute, each second
my head is full of you
baby i'm full
gets hotter and hotter
gets harder and harder to stop
get closer and closer
my heart is pounding, cool
what should i do, cool
my heart like this

i'll ask you out first
oh boy, the moment i wake up everyday
you're the person i think of first, my boy
since when have you been in my heart (hey you)
i was cold but i'm getting warmer, wow
i don't know what love is, a to z
i don't even know
my heart just gets drawn to only you
i just wanna shine towards you
i like you, i'm cool
each minute, each second
my head is full of you

gets hotter and hotter
gets harder and harder to stop
get closer and closer
my heart is pounding, cool
what should i do, cool
my heart like this

i'll ask you out first
left in an endless space
just you and me
unforgettable memories
like last night i didn't wake up from
all night
my heart like this is, cool
the place where my heart goes
i'll go anywhere you are

gets by my side slowly
get closer and closer
my heart is pounding, cool
would you cool me down, cool
i will first
woo

i gotta take you into our moonlight
before i let you inside of my heart
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
you make me feel so loonatic
looks like the night won't last much longer
give me your hand don't let me down
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
don't you run away now
i can see the shining moon above
omg we're going around and round don't fall
p r e t e n d to be mad
i don't really care now
remember how we used to play
i am not insane
dreaming of our own galaxies
i don't really care now
don't blame me
we're getting closer
come, play in oceans of mind
stay there, don't let me go
i don't really care now
looks like the stars won't shine much longer
give me your hand we're running out of time
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
aren't you excited now
i can see the shining moon above
omg stay round and round
p r e t e n d to be mad
i don't really care now
remember how we used to play
i am not insane
dreaming of our own galaxies
i don't really care now
don't blame me
we're getting closer
come, play in oceans of mind
stay there, don't let me go
i don't really care now
i gotta take you into our moonlight
before i let you inside of my heart
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
sometimes the stars shine brighter when the night is over
i can take you to another world
i don't really care now
remember how we used to say
i am not insane
dreaming in our own fantasies
i don't really care now
don't blame me
we're getting closer
come, play in oceans of mind
stay there, don't let me go
i don't really care now 


 hey boy
you wanna play?
it's a sweet crazy love
frozen hearts wake up one by one
after you came up in my cloudy heart
ran up in curiosity
and held my hand unknowingly
i was coloring it as we touched
(a little bit more)
as we get closer
the moment with you
heartbeats getting faster
(silent flow)
even the wind tickles me
i'm fluttered to meet you
you, sweet move move move, move me
look here, i've already filled you up
even your dangerous eyes taste sweet
all i see is your lips through any wordplay
come come come, come towards me
(bay bay bay)
only if you'd be with me
it's a sweet crazy love
boy, hearts towards you have come together to make
in the center of this throbbing is you
blow kiss on my cherry lips
boy, the song you played on the phone
amazing melody
(i wanna listen to it by myself)
(quietly)
your voice heard
the time with you
i've been waiting secretly
(silent flow)
in this night where even the wind falls asleep
it's fluttering to meet you
you, sweet move move move, move me
look here, i've already filled you up
even your dangerous eyes taste sweet
all i see is your lips through any wordplay
come come coem, come towards me
(bay bay bay)
only if you'd be with me
it's a sweet crazy love
indescribable with any words
full of that feeling
it's like a fairy tale
only in the movies
the love that would exist in
that's us
already started
sweet move move move, in the secrets
detonated in me, your cherry motion
i see just your lips through any tricks
always with you
we'll be together
come come come, i approach
(boy, today feels like a dream)
you and i getting deeper
(tell me, cause we only live once) it's a sweet crazy love
come come come, approach me
(don't know how to stop)
i'll hold your hand
blow kiss on my cherry lips
come come come, approach me
even the love that gets bigger and bigger
it's a sweet crazy love
it's a sweet crazy love
