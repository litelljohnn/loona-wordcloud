
hello, finally introducing loona

your scent so good, ever sweeter
(my heart pounds, why am i like this)

even my kidney pounds, it's hurting
(i guess i can't hide my feelings anymore)
oh i'm slowly sweetly addicted, love4eva

peeking again today, at your stories inside the timeline
i bet you don't know my crush (you know)

maybe i like it better this way

come on come on baby, tell me your story
oh our secret relationship
come on come on baby, close to me baby

(i guess i can't hide my feelings anymore)

first time my destiny, you know me, i'm egoistic
it doesn't make sense, this first love (you know)
approaching you, just a friend till now, in this moment
i'm afraid so what do i do

come on come on baby, tell me your story
as we deepen
come on come on baby, close to me baby
i'll come by softly
i flutter at your gaze, you
my arms and legs all melting down

your scent so good, ever sweeter
(my heart pounds, why am i like this)
oh from now on you're the only one i see, love4eva
even my kidney pounds, it's hurting
(i guess i can't hide my feelings anymore)
oh i'm slowly sweetly addicted, love4eva

even my kidney pounds, it's hurting
(i guess i can't hide my feelings anymore)
oh i'm slowly sweetly addicted, love4eva

the first moment when i gazed into your eyes
felt like meeting the summer i'd been seeking
trapped deep inside an icy castle
i only respond to you
because the key is inside that warm embrace

frozen, frozen
thaw me before it's too late
shine your light 
and bloom a flower upon frozen lands
hold me, hold me, oh now right now
thaw me, thaw me, make me warmer
hold me, hold me, deeper and deeper
and become my sun

for a long time, alone in a pale space
as if bound by gravity, i couldn't take a single step
while the seasons cycled through
if you sought me too
then open your heart, rescue me

frozen, frozen
thaw me before it's too late
shine your light
and bloom a flower upon frozen lands
hold me, hold me, oh now right now
thaw me, thaw me, make me warmer
hold me, hold me, deeper and deeper
and become my sun

i dream always and become a flower
from your warmth in full bloom, am i
(the frozen sky breaks away
the harsh winds stop
and you like the sun
this new season i've finally met
i'm afraid to break it, so would you thaw me
would you turn a long wait into a great excitement)

no way, no one
only you can do this
blooming, blooming
bloom a flower in my heart
hold me, hold me, oh now right now
thaw me, thaw me, make me warmer
hold me, hold me, deeper and deeper
and become my sun



in this unnamed and unfamiliar place
i feel i'm lost
no one comes to me

which way to go
as if trapped in a maze
i'm walking aimlessly

if i can see you, if i do see you
i want to ask maybe once, where i should go
you're my destiny, wherever you are

tell me you, on my path only you
to be on the same path even in the end
that was the promise we made
tell me you, i'm still the same in this place
our love is me alone, one way
continuing like this
be love, be love, be love
i know, i know, i know

i want to fill with pretty memories
and give it all to you
give me your hands

if i can see you, if i do see you
i want to ask maybe once, where i should go
you're my destiny, wherever you are

tell me you, on my path only you
to be on the same path even in the end
that was the promise we made
tell me you, i'm still the same in this place
our love is me alone, one way
continuing like this
be love, be love, be love
be love, be love, be love

the path we used to walk together
grows more faint
but i can't find my way back

tell me you, on my path only you
to walk the same path called love
that was the promise we made
tell me you, i'm still the same in this place
but your heart in the end has no way
blocked in every path
be love, be love, be love
i know, i know, i know
but i still love you



where is it from? a sound coming from somewhere
seems to have found me again, this familiar radio tone
(8 point 5, what is your signal?)
among the many faint noises, coming clear
is your feelings, making me fly (fly fly fly)

i feel like i'm getting lighter
elegant steps above the clouds in the sky
that moment when this world's gotten somehow so small
in the darkness

everything makes me flutter
shining just for me, the star called you
hey it'll be written into my heart
when i open my eyes, sprawling space in front of me

let's stay on the moon
on the way back there

it's happened somewhere, a rendezvous
someplace on a secret moon that's begun
(8 point 5, what is your signal?)
beyond the renewed time and space
it feels like it's just us two
(i'm in your eyes)

i feel like we're getting closer
in the eyes brimming with starlight
this world approaches first
in the darkness

everything makes me flutter
shining just for me, the star called you
hey it'll be written into my heart
when i open my eyes, sprawling space in front of me

let's stay on the moon

like shining stars falling down
where is this place?
like tiny rains all around
until i return
until the end of this month, will you be with me?
let me fly to the moon
finally

i feel like i've found it all
shining without anyone knowing, the star called you
hey would you rain down full in my heart
you're so close to me, enough to touch

let's stay on the moon
on the way back there
