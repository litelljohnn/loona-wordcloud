
don't hesitate, boy
your gaze shakes, shakes
a girl's heart flutters
a pleasant feeling

don't hesitate
and come near me
when you smile
boy you rock my world, you rock me baby

a pink-toned world, you and me
in this beautiful place tinged with sunlight
heart full of excitement
and following the winds
boy you just give me your love
with me, can you feel

24/7 i'll be there
day after day i'll be there
in hearts that become alike
i will be there
365 i'll be there
in that time i'll be there
us being together
i will be there

day day, anew every day
a pleasant excitement
i want to show it to your eyes
i will be there

laid out ahead of us
inside that time real slow
stopped in that place
is the world of you and me
a roundabout path
to dreamlike times
that are now facing me
make me feel so high, all the time

a pink-toned world, you and me
in this beautiful place tinged with sunlight
heart full of excitement
and following the winds
boy you just give me your love
with me, can you feel

24/7 i'll be there
day after day i'll be there
in hearts that become alike
i will be there
365 i'll be there
in that time i'll be there
us being together
i will be there

day day, anew every day
a pleasant excitement
i want to show it to your eyes
i will be there

ooh baby
the sunlight shining upon us
i'll be everything you need, i'll be everything you need

ooh baby
a heart-pounding moonlight
i'll be everything you need

24/7 i'll be there
day after day i'll be there
in hearts that become alike
i will be there
365 i'll be there
in that time i'll be there
us being together
i will be there

24/7 i'll be there
day after day i'll be there
in hearts that become alike
i will be there
365 i'll be there
in that time i'll be there
us being together
i will be there




today's no exception, i come again
what if i run into you
i'm gingerly waiting for you
there's nothing that i expect

blankly, blankly i gaze from a distance and leave
from afar, afar i hope i'm the only one who can see

hey you, do you know my heart
these days, like a child
i hide and look at you every day
you, are you listening to me
i don't have the courage yet
wordlessly, i come around you and leave

i close my eyes but you still come to mind
what do i do now?
everyone calls me foolish
but there's nothing more i want

hey you, do you know my heart
these days, like a child
i hide and look at you every day
you, are you listening to me
i don't have the courage yet
wordlessly, i come around you and leave

(why don't you say something) there's no way you know
(you can't let it pass) what do you think of me
such mundane words but i can't say them

again, blankly i gaze from a distance and leave
from afar, afar i hope i'm the only one who can see

hey you, do you know my heart
these days, like a child
i hide, look and run away
you, are you listening to me
because i don't have the courage yet
wordlessly, i come around you and leave
