
 your facial expressions towards me
turned cold at some moment
i wanted to despise you
but my heart wouldn't let you go
they say that time heals
even those words became pain for me
i couldn't get over you
all the petals of the flowers
that bloomed in my heart fall
my tears are on the tips of my toes
at the edge of the darkness
on the way home after sunset
that's where i saw the moonlight
from now on
i'll love myself
instead of you
i'll live on
take another step
to hold myself
and give myself all
love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
let you go today
hey, for the sin of swallowing you
you get bigger and bigger, beautiful you
you are me, now i'm you
little by little, soaked into my veins
on&on;, you and me the endless cycle
we can't be separated
when i miss you
i close my eyes and go to you for a while
close your eyes and you come closer to me
put my hands together
and ask for you back just once
my dreams that i prayed for
three kisses
the day when our promises became the light
that's when i realized
from now on
i'll love myself
instead of you
i'll live on
take another step
to hold myself
and give myself all
in the space with countless stars
you met me
it must not be a coincidence
it was fate
a blessing for me
from now on
i'll love myself
instead of you
i'll live on
take another step
to hold myself
and give myself all
love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
let you go today
love myself today
