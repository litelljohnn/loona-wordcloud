
 gets deeper, the nocturnal song
i can't stop it either, out of control
even when you don't know where it starts
color the night
chase and chase the sound, you and i running
(right behind)
deeper and deeper the secret gets
(fall into)
in the air that gets soaked and soaked in rain
(gets thicker)
hey, it gets thicker
everything about you and i
guilty of swallowing the sun in the afternoon
i'm right here, heated up
just you and i, left alone in this night
(ringing)
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
even i who was untouchably dangerous
what rounded me in an instant was your blue
stay with me until the end of this night
deep, deeper
we'll share a secret tonight
spreading in the sounds of rainfall, love song
show me more, your light all right
stay in me, all night
till the last moment, you stay right by my side
guilty of swallowing the sun in the afternoon
you smudged all in blue
you and i, standing atop this night
and this song is falling
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
and this song is falling
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
chase and chase the sound, you and i running
(right behind)
deeper and deeper the secret gets
(fall into)
in the air that gets soaked and soaked in rain
(gets colored)
hey, it gets colored
the sun between us now
guilty of swallowing the sun in the afternoon
i'm right here, heated up
just you and i, left alone in this night
(ringing)
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
singing in the rain
