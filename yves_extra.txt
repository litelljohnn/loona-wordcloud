
your appearance when i open my eyes
is too dazzling bright to approach
my desire to become like you
fills up with you, becomes colored

wanted to get closer to the sun
in burnt flapping of my wings
at my pathetic appearance i finally
got to know my new days

all my life, by my life
please look at me now
all my life, by my life

blooming like sweet temptation
the appearance of another myself inside of me
my face reflected in the mirror
who is that, i have to ask myself

in the cold morning air
the heart finally starts beating
that moment when i boldly faced myself
i got to know my new face

all my life, by my life
please look at me now
all my life, by my life

seemed close enough to touch if i reached
but the stage lights move further away
light, when the light inside my heart
quietly shines on my dreams

the new me got to know me
always, always all my life

all my life
renewed, new days
all my life, by my life
always all my life
i'll trust me, all my life
no matter what anyone says, by my life
in a bright light, all my life
i'll embrace myself, all my life



it's like a mundane joke
this unremarkable phone call
one hour then two passes by quickly
it's strange, how you feel?

a time when even the moonlight's grown deep
between a changed flow of time
give me more messages now
tell me, before the time out

(don't be shy)
predictable words
but trying to make them different tonight
(don't say bye)
needless nerves
could be covered up by this night we cross

the rainbow of shining stars, the studded bridge
our relationship hold on, don't release, or let go
tell me
what you wanna do?
what you wanna do?

the warmth passed over sweet breaths
feels like right this moment baby

how you like me now?
oh, might touch, might not, this feeling
surrounds me, tickling
swoops me up and makes me rise
just a step more for now
closely, slowly, come to me
how you like me? will you tell me now?

what's the hurry
the clock ticks without rest, yeah
there's not much left in the night
half of half of half of it, how you feel?

a time when even the moonlight's tilted
before the night's magic wears off
tell me, tell me yeah
who you want, who is it now?

the nervousness passed over your voice
feels like right this moment baby

how you like me now?
oh, might touch, might not, this feeling
surrounds me, tickling
swoops me up and makes me rise
just a step more for now
closely, slowly, come to me
how you like me? will you tell me now?

i wish things change from tomorrow on
i wish tonight's dream continues on
in the morning i wake, now with you
i can show my mind inside
it's right now baby
 
how you like me now?
oh, might come, might not, just a feeling
like a preservable
moment, it circles around me
just a step more for now
closely, slowly, come to me
how you like me? will you tell me now?
