
how handsome you are, as if it's nothing
i approach your side
how nervous i am, i like you so much
i want to hold you now

how handsome you are, as if it's nothing
i approach your side
how nervous i am, i like you so much
i want to hold you now

i love you, i need you
just like this, in your arms forever
i love you, i need you
like this, i've fallen for you

if only you liked me, if you loved me
because i miss you, so i can see you again
like a fool, thinking of you
another day goes by
if only you liked me, if you loved me
because i miss you, so i can see you again
like a fool
another day goes by

i couldn't say anything, as if i'm just fine
i look at you and smile
wouldn't you know how i feel, don't you know i feel like this
why, would you hold me now

i love you, i need you
little by little i fall for you
i love you, i need you
love's begun for me too

if only you liked me, if you loved me
because i miss you, so i can see you again
like a fool, thinking of you
another day goes by

ah-choo, i'm so happy
want you, you're all i know
it's you, you're so perfect
like this, my heart only points to you forever
anyone would be so jealous of us
our love would be more precious than anything
i want you to want me
slowly, our love will quietly blossom

should i come closer and kiss you
should i hold your hands and say
that i like you, and because i like you
i want to be with you

if only you liked me, if you loved me
because i miss you, so i can see you again
like a fool, thinking of you
another day goes by

if only you liked me, if you loved me
because i miss you, so i can see you again
like a fool, thinking of you
another day goes by
