with all my heart
i miss you, right now

what to do about these
feelings growing so unexpectedly
i wasn't like this at first
but now i'm nervous
when i think about you

your hands grazing the back of mine
got me surprised
are my thoughts too far ahead
how do you feel
why am i like this

i miss you right now
i want to meet you in this moment
in my daily routines
the problem of you is a big assignment
i want to solve it one by one
my heart is full of stories
that i want to share with you
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot
with all my heart

feelings grown this much in a day
how much more will they
it's as if i'm a girl who lives
only to wait
for your message

i miss you right now
i want to meet you in this moment
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot

in a nearby place
so close that you could reach out
laid out is my heart
i might cry at the slightest touch
if you know it all, would you come to me

i want to know
what kind of person am i to you
in my daily routines
the problem of you is a big assignment
i go through the day frustrated
right now, i want to meet you
i want to share many conversations
instead of my predictable dreams
i want to say in your comfortable arms
i like you a lot

yes i am
you are the only one
you are my miracle
i really like you a lot
with all my heart



hey, nothing ever matters you know
i don't understand what you're doing now
think of all the things, see the things you did
i heard you coming back, now baby turn around
on and on, we on the cycle, on and off
never fall for you again, that's it, imma lose my mind
on and on, don't matter, what we had, it's over now
reminiscing of the past, that's simply over now



will you whisper, you're the deja vu that wakes me up
now, is it you now?
about to bloom, a mirage with wings
how? is it true now?

a wind that embraces me
feels like i'm being born again
the gaze that fills me up (you)
perhaps it seems like a dream
in this moment dreams, dreams may come true

you're like - fly like a butterfly
wings, wings that will take me away
like this, fly like a butterfly
hearing the sound of winds, wing wing wing

fly like a butterfly
fly like a butterfly
i can almost touch
i better be around you
fly like a butterfly
fly like a butterfly
i better be around you

it's dizzying, everything around me is blue
now, with you, you now
a folded paper moon, as if to circle between it
i better be around you

it starts with a small flap, now inside my heart a hurricane
been been there, never been been there
the world becomes smaller
take me way too far, become new
in this moment dreams, dreams may come true

you're like - fly like a butterfly
wings, wings that will take me away
like this - fly like a butterfly
hearing the sound of winds, wing wing wing

like this
fly like a butterfly
i can almost touch
i better be around you
fly like a butterfly, all the way to the end
fly like a butterfly, even further away
fly like a butterfly, all the way to the end 
fly like a butterfly
i better be around you

synchronized above the clouds
this new feeling
bling, bling, shine like a starlight
breath-taking time
becoming more and more perfect
let me fly right now

you're like - fly like a butterfly
soar even higher, wings wings
like this, fly like a butterfly
the sound of winds rushing by, wing wing wing
i better be around you

fly like a butterfly, all the way to the end
wings, wings that will take me away
even further away
like this, fly like a butterfly
hearing the sound of winds
i can almost touch
i better be around you



yeah i'm talkin' bout you (yeah you yeah you)
yeah i'm talkin' bout you (come on boy)

lying to myself that i'm not afraid
heading towards that still-dark night
knowing nothing at first
i gazed at you, approached you
over and over again

i don't know, i don't know, i don't know bout you
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
wanna go, wanna go, wanna go around you
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
it's just unfamiliar and cold
you're not interested in me but
i'm okay, i'm fine being hurt
i want to go to your side

your gaze keeps avoiding me, but in the end
as time passes you might know
(gonna make it more)

circle, circle, circling around
i'm, i'm, i'm your planet
until i reach your side someday
closer, closer, come to me
overcome this gravity
that not even destiny will keep us apart

i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
at the end of this night we bloom
i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
remember me, me, me, your light

frequency of the moon, speech becoming like yours
were we perhaps one before
sometimes, you know, i believe in coincidence
i want to tell you, do you know

getting tired in passing time
just tell me one word, when will it be
the moment you come to me

tears flow sometimes but i don't hate it
because the moonlight has gifted its shadow
(gonna make it more)

circle, circle, circling around
i'm, i'm, i'm your planet
until i reach your side someday
closer, closer, come to me
overcome this gravity
that not even destiny will keep us apart

i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
at the end of this night we bloom
i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
remember me, me, me, your light

actually you know, rather than starlight
i prefer that steady moonlight
people don't know
don't know what's more precious
i can only see you when that moon rises

satellite
satellite
satellite
towards you i fly, fly

circle, circle, circling around
i'm, i'm, i'm your planet
until i reach your side someday
closer, closer, come to me
overcome this gravity
that not even destiny will keep us apart

i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
at the end of this night we bloom
i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you
remember me, me, me, your light

circle, circle, circling around
i'm, i'm, i'm your planet
the moment i'll reach your side someday
i'm talkin' bout you, i'm talkin' bout you



(curiosity)
to you, the wind blowing onto me
i've lost everything in a moment, yeah
inside a twisted spacetime
the blue horizon sprawling beneath our feet

i'm attracted to the gaze, transparent as if reflected by a mirror
it's not simple curiosity
in this feeling, blooming in a quick moment
i'm melting in softly
like a secret, i
want to solve you, all right

curious, i've fallen more into excitement
learning about you little by little
curious, in the heat that would burn it all up
look at us facing each other
(don't mean anything)
i got the question 'bout you
i got the question 'bout us
curiosity

my heartbeat towards you, you're sunlight shining on me
gradually increasing in my heart,
a little greed builds up
and shines as stars filling this night, oh

i know, this isn't a question mark
it's a surefire signal
na, na guess you're getting greedy
guess you're gaining courage
right now in my head, you
i'm only curious about you
how do i escape you baby
it just gets deeper, all right

curious, i've fallen more into excitement
learning about you little by little
curious, in the heat that would burn it all up
look at us facing each other
(don't mean anything)

it approached like a little wind
this fluttering that began in curiosity
it's like a hurricane
hard to turn it back
i've become new after meeting you

butterflies in my heart
i want to be with you

curious, wanna be more addicted
to being together with you
curious, under the sky that seems to burn up
look at us together
(don't mean anything)
i got the question 'bout you
i got the question 'bout us
curiosity



will you tell me my tastes?
can't take off my purple eyes
very transparently, sometimes clearly
relax the nerves and again, do it
appropriate, yes, i've picked you
i see you there
giving off bright light

as if mesmerized by something
inside the mirror mirror
even if i can't know
which is real
i can ever more
pick you out

i go i go i go
i just wanna feeling
for you i've got instinctive impulse
i go i go i go
i just wanna love you
this is all a determined scene, yeah
i go i go i go
i go i go i go

draw in a color deeper than blue
so that i can be seen, my heart be seen
colored a little more by me, you and i
as if it's destiny already

as if mesmerized by something
inside the mirror mirror
even if i can't know
which is real
like a magnet
you pull me in

i go i go i go
i just wanna feeling
for you i've got instinctive impulse
i go i go i go

oh where you at

hey, if i still miss you like before
if i pray every day to see you
if i wish for you, would you come back and hold me

back then, when i tossed
the thorny words that scratched you
i want to turn it back, want to see you again
oh where you at

every day i think of
your warmth that would make me smile
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
every time i think of
our happiness where i'd dream in your arms
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
i only wait for you

i want to know, yeah
your heart that day you turned around
yeah, if it's still the same come back to that spot
if you wish, find me, if you wish me
blankly i wait for you every day

always so intimate to me
your soft speech
i want to turn it back, want to see you again
oh where you at

every day i think of
your warmth that would make me smile
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
i only wait for you

memories of you (slowly slowly)
fade away, lose their color
if you're the same way
once more, i want to paint us

every day i think of
your warmth that would make me smile
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
every time i think of
our happiness where i'd dream in your arms
oh where you at, oh where you at, oh where you at
