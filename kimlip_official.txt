
 this is our fantasy
come to me, follow me
shaking in my heart (hush)
suffocating
hey baby
your eyes that have grazed me secretly
it makes me fluttered
(cupid love)
in just one moment
breath gets loose and fall
spreading endlessly
sweet voice
that i heard in the dreams
(look behind)
it has started, eclipse
in the hidden shadows
where you and i faced each other
happening in the destiny
hearts drawn to each other shining on the love
gets even more closer
this is eclipse
it's difficult to take my eyes off
so would you be with me continuously
unforgettable eclipse
it's destiny
it's neat how there are so many colors different from me
hidden in the heart (color)
let's show it
hey baby
i wanna see it under the lights secretively
i'm so curious, it makes me crazy
(cupid love)
smudged in the light
your heart visible in just one look
it's like pandora's box
silhouette like a painting in the mirror
call you up
(by my side)
it has started, eclipse
in the hidden shadows
where you and i faced each other
happening in the destiny
hearts drawn to each other shining on the love
gets even more closer
this is eclipse
it's difficult to take my eyes off
so would you be with me continuously
unforgettable eclipse
it's destiny
quiet early morning
(hold me with your arms around me)
like a fog that has bloomed
(must have bloomed silently)
i'll let myself bloom in your heart
(after time passes)
eternally, so it won't disappear
continuous eclipse
in the hidden shadows
where you and i faced each other
happening in the destiny
hearts drawn to each other shining on the love
gets even more closer
this is eclipse
it's difficult to take my eyes off
so would you be with me continuously
this is eclipse
it's destiny
it's difficult to take my eyes off
so would you be with me continuously
unforgettable eclipse
