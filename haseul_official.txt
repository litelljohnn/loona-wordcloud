is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
that little wish that i've been dreaming
only if you will be with me
like in that song
the sounds of the bells around my ears
and the white snow i've been waiting
christmas melodies heard around every white street corners
i can't wait for that day of december
it has become a long lost memory but
the world became white overnight
it feels like something is about to happen
when those twinkling little lights fall on my heart
i'll have my courage to tell you how long i've waited
is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
that little wish that i've been dreaming
only if you'll be with me (only you)
the sounds of the bells around my ears
and the white snow i've been waiting
pile up in my heart, just between the two of us
it's christmas time
deep in the night, praying for my wishes to come true
can't fall asleep, been waiting all night
full of memories
when those little twinkling lights go on
i'll have my courage to tell you how long i've waited
it's you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh baby
that little wish that i've been dreaming
only if you'l'l be with me (only you)
the sounds of the bells around my ears
and the white snow i've been waiting
pile up in my heart, just between the two of us
it's christmas time
december, heart throbbing like the girl of the month
i get reminded when i'm with you
it feels like everything will go the right way with you
it keeps pounding and pounding
that little miracle that i've been wanting to happen
only if you'll be with me (only you)
childhood memories and precious recollections
it feels like i'm reliving it
please be with me
my christmas time 



inside my heart, the place that's deep and dark
you barged in
one day, it will fall asleep again but
please wake my world up
it can't be a coincidence
you can't rush
sweet whisper
above the night sky, let me in
the moon rises
i eventually become you
we, so different us two
my heart
get colored with you
the girl is the boy's girl
wind blows deep inside my heart
let a flower petal float
it may go cold again but
defrost my heart
you there, knocking
i hesitate
when i wake up from this dream in the long night
will i be you? or will you be me?
i've been waiting for too long
the moon rises
i eventually become you
we, so different us two
my heart
gets colored with you
the girl is the boy's girl
looking more like you
becoming more used to you
solely your girl
the moon rises
i eventually become you
we, so different us two
when i see you
my heart moves
the girl is the boy's girl
the boy is the girl's boy
the girl is the boy's
wish
