every morning, you show up at nine o'clock
i see you everyday but i get excited again
it's awkward
and i feel a bit shy but
i like you back
i'm quite bad at expressing myself
you know what i mean
even when i don't say the exact words
i like you back, and i believe in you too
so please understand how i feel
stop surprising me like that
don't put your lips on me without any warning
it's too quick
just give me a hug
a kiss will happen later
kiss later
(kiss later)
kiss later
kiss later
i'm not like one of the characters in a romantic movie
but i'm not just a little child either
girls, they just want to check and make sure again
you should stop begging
like a little boy
just look at me
like a mature guy
if you like me
if it's your truth
would you let me trust you?
stop surprising me like that
don't put your lips on me without any warning
it's too quick
just give me a hug
kiss later
even a little bit, when your hand braces me
pounding and pounding, i get chills
don't try to move forward too quickly
acting like you're playing
or like you're frustrated
it won't work
i need myself to be ready first
so wait
i like you back
but please give me just a hug today
it's too quick
that will be all for today
a kiss will happen later
kiss later
(kiss later)
kiss later
kiss later 


 oh, when i opened my eyes after closing it for a while
(then i)
it feels like i'm in a new world
melody calling me
i'm already walking towards the direction
indescribable attraction
unfamiliar landscapes
and streets full of sunset
my smiles get bigger
you're like sunday
sunday, my sunday
exciting like a vacation
wanna be wanna be your love
makes another day so special
shining like a star up in the sky
you're sunday, sunday, sunday

oh, memory from the time that stopped for a while
(i remember)
it feels like i'm born again
melody welcoming me
i'm already walking towards the direction
it needs no description
unfamiliar recollections adding up
everything is so precious
you're like sunday
sunday, my sunday
exciting like a vacation,
wanna be wanna be your love
makes another day so special
shining like a star up in the sky
even when i sprint until i run out of breath
i couldn't see the end of a day
yesterday that has passed
it will come now
the day that's more radiant than the sun
you're sunday sunday

will you hold my hand

even more today for some reason
wanna be wanna be your love
makes another day so special
