
 when the backs of our hands grazed while walking
you gave me your glass of lemonade
all day because of the flutters you gave me
my heart is bloated to its maximum
inflated like a bubble gum, my heart
i don't know what love is
a to z, i don't know yet
this feeling of tips of my ears shaking
fallen into, love cherry motion
one summer night, into the purple dreams
love cherry magic
dreaming with you of paradise
in my eyes, in my heart, you are there
get deeper into my arms, you
love cherry motion
a story starting today
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
when you call my name behind me
i'm already in front of you like a magnet
never felt this way before
but it's not so bad for some reason
started very suddenly, this story
this feeling that tickles my ears
fallen into, love cherry motion
one summer night, into the purple dreams
love cherry magic
dreaming with you of paradise
in my eyes, in my heart, you are there
get deeper into my arms, you
love cherry motion
a story starting today
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
ah ah, imagine
hold my shaking hand
you already know even when i don't say it, don't you?
if you stare again
at my bad poker face, i'm so into you
it's like being in the clouds
fallen into, love cherry motion
step towards you with courage
love cherry magic
my dreams are full of you
in my eyes, in my heart, you are there
all my world is too bright in my eyes
love cherry motion
starting today, special days
