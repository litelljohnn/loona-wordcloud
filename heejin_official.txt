already in the morning, dejavu
unfamiliar but same old day
should i hide? should i run?
i contemplate
shuffle through the black hat
same things get grabbed as always
either a white rabbit or a dove
that's all same
everyday, flash in my heart, rainbow that used to shine
this world without any colors, it's boring
would you change it with your fingertips?
red orange yellow green, more vividly be okay?
oh my god yes
say, oh my god yes
color me whole, with many colors
oh my god yes
say, oh my goodness
i keep smiling all day
until my heart goes pounding
fill me up with many colors, red oragne yellow green
something highlight
surprising changes
i keep smiling all day
until my heart goes pounding
happy ending, same ending once again
me without you, so what i can do?
empty repertoires
stop it, stop
i want to walk, like runway
chic but different
i'll show myself to you
that's my heart
everyday, flash in my heart, rainbow that used to shine
same old black and white movie, it's boring
would you change it with your fingertips?
red orange yellow green, more vividly be okay?
oh my god yes
say, oh my god yes
color me whole, with many colors
oh my god yes
say, oh my goodness
i keep smiling all day
since the day i met you
good morning, i wish for a new day each day i wake up
i don't want to become numb towards myself without the light
oh my god yes
say like today
like this, full with more colors
same color
say unique color
everything puts me on my toes, making my heart go crazy
fill me up with many colors, red orange yellow green
something highlight
surprising changes
i keep smiling all day
because you're smiling at me
